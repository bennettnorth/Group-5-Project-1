Rail Potential in Texas


The aim of our project is to uncover opportunities to increase passenger rail ridership between the cities of Dallas and Austin in lieu of Airline flights. We’ll examine relationships between population projections, emissions, travel time, and other related relationships derived from the data to conclude if increasing rail usage between Austin and Dallas could reduce Texas’ overall fuel consumption for airlines. 

Population Growth in Austin and Dallas

In 2011 the population of Austin was a little over 1.7 million. By 2019, the population had boomed to over 2.2 million people.
The Dallas population graph shows a similar trend. In 2011, the population was approximately 6.5 million and by 2019 it had grown to over 7.5 million
It is clear the populations of Austin and Dallas are growing rapidly, and it’s more important than ever to consider the options for connecting the two cities.

Flight Connections 

The cities of Austin and Dallas are growing rapidly. Dallas Fort Worth is a major hub for airline travel in the US - meaning many passengers coming to or from Austin inevitably connect through Dallas. Using the FlightAware Flight API, we were able to discover there are, on average, 13 flights each way each day. Meaning approximately 26 flights a day, or 9500 flights a year connecting the two cities. This is an incredible amount of airline travel for two cities separated by relatively flat plains and a robust existing rail network.

Fuel Consumption By Mode

Trains are running on less diesel fuel by volume per trip every year in comparison to aircrafts using jet fuel. Meaning overall, there is less fuel being burned and less availability for CO2 emissions to increase. Trains burn about 200 gallons of diesel fuel an hour. While an Airbus A319-100, the smallest aircraft type flying between Austin and Dallas, can burn upto 686.8 gallons of jet fuel per hour. One one-way train trip from Austin to Dallas only burns 1,163.34 gallons of diesel fuel over the course of the 5 hour and 49 minute train ride. While the same one way trip for an Airbus A319-100 would burn 744.03 gallons of jet fuel in the 1 hour and 5 minute flight between the two cities.

Existing Rail Lines

The current amtrak route connecting Austin and Dallas takes approximately 6 hours and 32 minutes - a far cry from the short ~1 hour flight. The existing Amtrak connection makes 5 stops on its way to Austin. If we want rail to be a viable option to connect the two cities, we need to have a serious conversation about the schedule and speed of service offered by Amtrak. That said, the emissions implications of shifting even a portion of travelers to rail cannot be understated. Additionally, the experience of rail can often be more enjoyable than flying. No waiting around in the terminal, no security, and most importantly, a beautiful view out the window as you cruise across the land

Carbon Emissions By Fuel Type

Jet fuel emits a substantially larger load of CO2 into the atmosphere while trains maintain a smaller CO2 footprint (small blue bars near the bottom) regardless of population growth rates. There are still active train rails from Austin to Dallas. As population growth for these major cities shows a steady trend higher upwards, we recommend taking the train whenever possible if commuting between these two major destinations.
