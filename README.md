Rail Potential in Texas

Project Ideation

The aim of our project is to uncover opportunities to increase passenger rail ridership between the cities of Dallas and Austin in lieu of Airline flights. We’ll examine relationships between population projections, emissions, travel time, and other related relationships derived from the data to conclude if increasing rail usage between Austin and Dallas could reduce Texas’ overall fuel consumption for airlines. 
Questions to gain insight on our problem:
What are the growth rates of Austin and Dallas? 
Census Population projections
How many existing tracks connect the two cities? 


What is the average fuel consumption for the different modes of transportation for a distance of this length? 
Trains vs. Planes
How will future population growth affect future emissions?
Impact on fuel usage by the gallon
Plane jet fuel vs trains Diesel fuel
